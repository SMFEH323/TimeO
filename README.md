# TimeO
 
TimeO is a software application developed for the US Military Academy 2014 Orienteering Meet at Lake Frederick. It utilizes efficient recursive backtracking methods to ensure fast computation and optimal solutions for event timing and tracking.

## Description

The TimeO project encompasses a comprehensive suite of digital resources used during the orienteering event. It includes a detailed map of Lake Frederick, course files, and the TimeO software, which is designed to manage and time the event efficiently using advanced algorithmic techniques.

## Installation

Clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the Java application:

## Usage

Execute the `graph.jar` file to launch the TimeO software. Use the provided `.map` files with GIS-compatible software to view maps and courses. TimeO's software utilizes recursive backtracking to calculate the most efficient routes and timing solutions during the event.
